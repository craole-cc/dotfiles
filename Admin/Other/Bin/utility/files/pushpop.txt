Show me a shellscript that can jumps into a directory (workDIR), run a command (COMMAND) and return to the original directory or one specified by the user (returnDIR).

- Use multiple functions for readability
- include options (
  -v|--version for version
  -h|--help for help/usage
  -q | -d |--verbose for verbosity allow -dd for info and -d for error -q for quiet
  allow --verbose=info --verbose=quiet --verbose=error
  -R | --cd| --rd [PATH]  for returnDIR
  -W | --wd [PATH] for workDIR
  -c | --command [COMMAND] for command
  *) WorkDIR="$1" Command="$2" returnDIR="$PWD"
  )
- put all printing in a separate function for usage, version and errors
- use heredoc for usage
- use prinf instead of echo
- Prioritize efficiency, portability and POSIX compliance.
- Merge verbosity options as best as possible
