: <<'DOCUMENTATION'
  This test script tests various scenarios such as replacing the first or all occurrences of a pattern, replacing a pattern at the beginning or end of a line, replacing a pattern in all lines or a specific line, etc. It also sets up a test file `dis2dat.txt` with some sample text to run the tests on.
