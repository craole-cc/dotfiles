How to set hostname for a host.

This repo is structured in a way that allows managing multiple hosts
in a single repo.  As a consequence of this, hostname appears in
several different places and should be updated together if needed.

The entry point of this repo is ``flake.nix'' file, which takes a
revision of the nixpkgs as input then gives an attribute set (attrset)
as output:

  {
    nixosConfigurations = {
      exampleHost = { ... };
      host2 = { ... };
      host3 = { ... };
      ...
    };
  }


The hostname specified here inside nixosConfigurations attrset is used
when ``nix command'' is invoked, as in

  nixos-install --flake ./#exampleHost

The hostname also appears in the filesystem path of the per-host
configuration file:

  hosts/exampleHost/default.nix
  hosts/host2/default.nix
  ...

Finally, the hostname is specified in the zfs-boot.networking.hostName
option inside per-host configuration file at
hosts/exampleHost/default.nix:

  zfs-boot.networking.hostName = "exampleHost";

If the value of this option is identical to the name of
nixosConfigurations.<hostname> attrset, all subsequent invocations of
``nix command'' will default to this hostname, i.e. the command:

  nixos-rebuild boot

will automatically append ``#hostName'' when evaluating the flake.
